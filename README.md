# cosmic-ts
This is an attempt at coding along the book [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/), but with Typescript, as part of our tech-book-club at MADE.
The idea is to make a chapter branch for each chapter of the book, in a similar way to that of how Bob and Harry structured [their code repository](https://github.com/cosmicpython/code).

## Quick instructions:
1) make sure you run `npm install` everytime you change branch.
2) To run your tests, use `npm test`.

If you get weird errors, do try deleting your `node_modules` folder and run step 1) again

That's really it.

If you would like to contribute, please open a PR (to the right branch). :)
